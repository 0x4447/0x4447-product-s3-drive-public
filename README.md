# ðŸ’£ 0x4447 S3 Self-destruct Drive

We created this stack as an alternative to Dropbox, a special bucket that any object uploaded is publicly available to temporary sharing of uploaded object with a customizable self-destruct timer. When you deploy the stack you can set after how many days the object should be deleted, this way you can upload a file, share the URL to it, and be confident that the object will be automatically deleted by AWS. After uploading there is nothing more to manage.

# DISCLAIMER!

This stack is available to anyone at no cost, but on an as-is basis. 0x4447 LLC is not responsible for damages or costs of any kind that may occur when you use the stack. You take full responsibility when you use it.

# How to deploy

<a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=zer0x4447-S3-Drive-Self-destruct&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/0x4447-drive-cloudformation/s3-drive-self-destruct.json">

All you need to do to deploy this stack is click the button to the left and follow the instructions that CloudFormation provides in your AWS Dashboard. Alternatively you can download the CF file from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/0x4447-drive-cloudformation/s3-email.json).

# What will deploy?

The stack takes advantage of AWS S3 and AWS IAM Groups. You'll get:

- 1x S3 Bucket
- 1x S3 Policy
- 1x IAM Group

# Manual work

After the stack is deployed the only thing left is to create a IAM user or use a pre-existing one and attach to this user the IAM Group that was created with the bare minimum actions needed to work with the bucket.

# How to work with this project

When you want to deploy the stack, the only file you should be interested in is the `CloudFormation.json` file. If you'd like to modify the stack, we recommend that you use the [Grapes framework](https://github.com/0x4447/0x4447-cli-node-grapes), which was designed to make it easier to work with the CloudFormation file. If you'd like to keep your sanity, never edit the main CF file ðŸ¤ª.
